# ItemEditor

Indexes, loads and renders item meshes from the provided `Item_org.tbl` and your database (using ODBC - DSN: `KN_online`, user: `knight`, password: `knight`).

Item meshes must exist in `Item/` (relative to the ItemEditor's working directory).

This tool was written by [@srmeier](https://github.com/srmeier) and was originally part of the [main OpenKO repository](https://github.com/Open-KO/KnightOnline).
